### mono

- `mono` applies a monotonicity rule.
- `mono*` applies monotonicity rules repetitively.
- `mono using x ≤ y` or `mono using [0 ≤ x,0 ≤ y]` creates an assertion for the listed
  propositions. Those help to select the right monotonicity rule.
- `mono left` or `mono right` is useful when proving strict orderings:
   for `x + y < w + z` could be broken down into either
    - left:  `x ≤ w` and `y < z` or
    - right: `x < w` and `y ≤ z`

### ac_mono

`ac_mono` reduces the `f x ⊑ f y`, for some relation `⊑` and a
monotonic function `f` to `x ≺ y`.

`ac_mono*` unwraps monotonic functions until it can't.

`ac_mono^k`, for some literal number `k` applies monotonicity `k`
times.

`ac_mono h`, with `h` a hypothesis, unwraps monotonic functions and
uses `h` to solve the remaining goal. Can be combined with * or ^k:
`ac_mono* h`

`ac_mono : p` asserts `p` and uses it to discharge the goal result
unwrapping a series of monotonic functions. Can be combined with * or
^k: `ac_mono* : p`

In the case where `f` is an associative or commutative operator,
`ac_mono` will consider any possible permutation of its arguments and
use the one the minimizes the difference between the left-hand side
and the right-hand side.
